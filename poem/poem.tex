\textbf{Hibernation}\\
\textsc{Katja Rogers}\\
\ \\

This quicksand of my own making has grown teeth and claws\\
And snarls at me from behind the splintered door.\\
At every glance, my skin grows cold until I shake and shiver\\
And my icicle hair begins to splinter and burst.\\

This winter I plan to hibernate in books,\\
Make a second skin out of handwritten pages and leather covers.\\
I will carve a deep tunnel through crumbling layers of wallpaper,\\
And I will be safe, and think nothing.\\

But in spring, in summer---the world is dipped into heat and haze\\
And only some of us will make it through to its end\\
With sunburns, cracked lips, and shaking fingers.
