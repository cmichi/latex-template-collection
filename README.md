# README

This is a collection of LaTeX and XeTeX templates.  
There is still room for optimization, so please feel free to contribute!

Some of the templates use proprietary fonts. If you have problems compiling
just remove the command which sets a custom font.

The `curriculum-vitae/` folder contains a Makefile, if you use something else to compile the
document be sure to use the XeLaTeX/XeTeX engine.
This template uses the font Minion Pro. If you don't have it installed on
your system uncomment the line 112 `\setmainfont{Minion Pro}` in the `cv.tex`
file.

## Academic Paper/Essay

[![Paper/Proposal Template](https://github.com/cmichi/latex-template-collection/raw/master/images/paper.png)](https://github.com/cmichi/latex-template-collection/raw/master/paper/paper.pdf)

[Link to PDF](https://github.com/cmichi/latex-template-collection/raw/master/paper/paper.pdf)

The `paper/` folder contains a Makefile. In order to compile the entire
paper execute `make biber`. If you use something else to compile the
document be sure to use the XeLaTeX/XeTeX engine.
This template uses the font Palatino Linotype, if you don't have it installed on
your system uncomment line 7 `\setmainfont{Palatino Linotype}` in the 
file `paper.tex`.

I built the template for my thesis proposal, it is heavily inspired by an old
ACM template which was used in e.g. the classical [UNIX paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=361061).


## XeTeX Letter

You might have to compile the file two times for the folding marks to 
show up.
